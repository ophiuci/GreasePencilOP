# GreasePencilOP
This is a Blender Grease Pencil Addon

**Description:**
<p>This addon is currently a simple script which moves the Blender 3D Cursor to the Grease Pencil points near the pointer in a 3D view. The idea being to leave the Grease Pencil stroke placement option locked to 3D Cursor and switching Drawing Plane option from front, side, and top to quickly sketch out 3D objects.
<p>The operation is mapped to F5, and would be using while drawing with Grease Pencil.


**Reasoning:**
<p>The addon exists, because I could not determine a way to provide this quick workflow of sketching on a plane, and then creating a cross section based on the position of an element in that sketch.
<p>This tool exists because I felt it would aid in my own ideal workflow for grease pencil at the moment, which is basically just sketching out rough ideas in 3D to have that quick perspective aid before switching over to Photoshop to finish up with the illustration.
<p>The ideas spawned after Jama Jurabaev's great BLENDER: Grease Pencil Tutorial which is available at: https://www.artstation.com/jama/store/dPB/blender-grease-pencil-tutorial
